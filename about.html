 Hi, I’m Rizwana Naznin C A. I’m a Web Developer with a passion for creating responsive and user-friendly websites that don’t just look good—they work perfectly.

With over a year of hands-on experience, I’ve specialized in helping students and peers navigate the complexities of college projects. I know how stressful it can be to bridge the gap between a classroom theory and a fully functional web application, and that’s where I come in.

My approach is simple: I believe that clean, readable code is the key to success. Whether I’m building a dynamic React application or a sleek portfolio site, my goal is always to deliver results that are both functional for the user and meaningful for the grade.

When I’m not at my desk, you can usually find me hiking local trails or exploring the latest frameworks in the JavaScript ecosystem to stay ahead of the curve.
